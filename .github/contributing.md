- Update any relevant development or end user documentation
- Create a pull request and fill out the information required in the pull request template:
  -  Tag one or more reviewers
  -  Tag yourself (and any other) contributors as assignees
  -  Use the appropriate labels
  -  Create the request against an appropriate branch. 
     -  Feature/Fix branches -> Staging. 
     -  Staging -> Master.
  
You may merge your pull request after it has been approved by at least one reviewer. Avoid merging any pull requests if the CI tests fail.
